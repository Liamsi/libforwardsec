Libforwardsec. A library for forward secure encryption.

This depends on relic (https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) and assuming relic is configured to use it, GMP. Install both. 
It also usees cereal(https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) for serialization.


Known to build on OSX  with Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn).

This project builds with cmake.
cd build/ 
cmake ../
make 
make check # builds and runs tests.

Note, Cmake supports a bunch of other build systems via "cmake -G 'generator name' ../"
Among them Ninja (which is possibly faster than make) and project files for your favorite/
least favorite IDEs (xcode, eclipse,visualstudio, etc)

For a full list of supported build systems run:
cmake --help
