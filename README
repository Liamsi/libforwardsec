Libforwardsec. A library for forward secure encryption.

This project depends on: 

	* For math: 
		relic (https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) 
		* gmp (assuming relic is configured to use it) 
	* For serialization:
		*  cereal(https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) 
	


This project builds with cmake.

	cd build/ 
	cmake ../
	make 
	make check # builds and runs tests.

It is known to build and pass all tests on OSX 10.9.5  with Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn) and Ubuntu 14.04 with gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 


Note, Cmake supports a bunch of other build systems via "cmake -G 'generator name' ../"
Among them Ninja (which is possibly faster than make) and project files for your favorite/
least favorite IDEs (xcode, eclipse,visualstudio, etc)

For a full list of supported build systems run:
cmake --help
