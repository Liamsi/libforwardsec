This project builds with cmake.
cd build/ #(If you are reading this you may already be there)
cmake ../
make 
make check # runs tests.

Note, Cmake supports a bunch of other build systems via "cmake -G 'generator name' ../"
Among them Ninja (which is possibly faster than make) and project files for your favorite/
least favorite IDEs (xcode, eclipse,visualstudio, etc)

For a full list of supported buld systems run:
cmake --help
